## Implementation Summary
For this assignment, I built a fully functional iOS-style JavaScript calculator using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The calculator supports all required operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, sign toggle, decimals, clear, and equals. It also includes full keyboard support.

I integrated the calculator into my portfolio from Assignment 3 and added a project card that links to the calculator. The project follows the required directory structure and includes separate files for HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Directory Structure:** The required folder naming caused Git issues, but I solved it by renaming the directory and reorganizing files.
- **Calculator Logic:** Avoiding `eval()` required writing my own calculation functions.
- **Keyboard Input:** Had to write key mappings manually.

## Extra Features
(None)

## Resources Used
- MDN Web Docs (JavaScript functions and DOM)
- W3Schools CSS Grid reference
